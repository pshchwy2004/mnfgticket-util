## Introduction

Hello to anyone who has stumbled across my program! I am (as of writing) an aspiring software engineer enrolled at the University of Maryland. In my plight of summer unemployment I took a job at a family member's nail salon, whose way of running the front of the store was, in my opinion, severely outdated and cumbersome when it came to logistics (as if talking to people wasn't bad enough!). 

I began writing this program three days ago in order to alleviate some of these issues, primarily the dual-pricing system that they use to calculate cash and card prices of certain products/services. I also wanted to create a ticketing system that would not only allow me to keep track of everything that was going on, but also calculate prices instantly. 

I hope this project of mine was an interesting read for you at the least.
